# Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end pharmaceutical manufacturing analytics workflow.

The goal is to simulate a realistic manufacturing data environment and analyze it using:
- PostgreSQL (pgAdmin)
- SQL
- Power BI
- Microsoft Fabric

The project is intentionally built from scratch to capture real-world challenges such as:
- Database setup
- Data loading
- Tool limitations
- Debugging and execution order

Each phase of the project is documented step by step.
